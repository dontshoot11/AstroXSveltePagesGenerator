# Astro x Svelte Static Pages Generator

This is a static page generator built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), with custom scripts added for convenient multilingual support.

The project follows the [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) philosophy: most computations are handled during the build process, producing a clean project with interactive "islands" created with Svelte.

A custom solution is used to support multilingual capabilities.

## Getting Started

To start, install packages:

```bash
npm i astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator@latest
```

Then, install dependencies

```bash
npm i astro-relative-links
```

After installation, a basic project template will be set up. Feel free to modify it as needed; the template is provided for reference.

## Localization

In the translations folder of the template project, you’ll find sample JSON files with key-value pairs and helper functions for managing translations.

Create an array strings with language prefixes that you will need.

1. During development, write the [getStaticPaths](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/routing-reference/#getstaticpaths) function, which will take this array and use it during the iteration to build paths for localized pages. If you don’t need a language prefix for the default text page, add an `undefied` to `getStaticProps` - it will build directories without language prefixies using default language to localize.

`getStaticPaths` example

```Astro
---
import DemoComponent from "@components/DemoComponent/DemoComponent.svelte";
import { getTranslate } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator";

import Layout from "src/layout/Layout.astro";

export const locales = ["en", "es"];

type PathType = {
  params: {
    locale?: string;
  };
};

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const allPaths: PathType[] = [];
  allPaths.push({
    params: {
      locale: undefined,
    },
  });
  for (const locale of locales) {
    allPaths.push({
      params: {
        locale: locale,
      },
    });
  }

  return allPaths;
}
---

<Layout title={getTranslate("title", "titleFallback")}>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>{getTranslate("wake_up", "wake up fallback")}</h1>
    <DemoComponent client:only="svelte" />
  </div>
</Layout>

```

2. In a high-level component, such as `Layout`, store Astro.url in a global variable to make it accessible during static site generation.

```Astro
---
globalThis.AstroUrl = Astro.url;
---

```

3. In the same component, add the required translations to a data attribute on the <html> tag so they are available on the client side.

```Astro
---
import { getCurrentLang } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator";
const currentLang = getCurrentLang();
const translations = globalThis.clientTranslations;
---

<!doctype html>
<html
  lang={currentLang}
  dir={dir}
  data-page-translations={JSON.stringify(translations[currentLang])}
>

```

4. Register the translation plugin in astro.config.mjs to enable localization support.

```mjs
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import { customTranslationPlugin } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator/translationUtils/customTranslationPlugin.mjs";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [customTranslationPlugin()],
});
```

5. To use translations after proper setup, simply call the getTranslate function with the translation key as the first argument and a fallback string as the second argument (used as the default value). You can use the function in any context — it will automatically access the appropriate set of translation keys at runtime.

Using translates:

```Astro
---
import { getTranslate } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator";
---

<p>{getTranslate('key', 'default value')}</p>

```

## Utility Functions

Several helpful functions are included in the project for general use:

### `debounce`

Limits the number of times a function is called within a specified period. It takes a function as the first argument and a delay as the second. This decorator is useful when you need to reduce the number of function calls, such as during page scroll or resize events.

**Example**: A user types in a field, and `debounce` resets a timer, waiting until typing stops. Once the user finishes (e.g., after 300 ms), the function is triggered.

```javascript
import { debounce } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator";
const debouncedFunction = debounce(() => console.log("Function call"), 300);
window.addEventListener("resize", debouncedFunction);
```

### `throttle`

Another decorator that reduces function call frequency, ensuring the function is called no more than once within a given interval.

**Example**: During scrolling, throttle ensures the function is called once every specified period (e.g., every 200 ms), regardless of the scroll frequency.

```javascript
import { throttle } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator";
const throttledFunction = throttle(() => console.log("Function call"), 200);
window.addEventListener("resize", throttledFunction);
```

### `getOS`

Returns the operating system based on the user's browser user agent.

Note: This function only works on the client side.

```javascript
import { getOS } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator";
const OS = getOS();
```

### `getCurrentLang`

Returns page locale. Works in Astro context, can be passed as data-lang.

```javascript
import { geCurrentLang } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator";
const currentLang = getCurrentLang();
```

### `checkDate`

Checks if a specified date has passed, returning a boolean.

```javascript
import { checkDate } from "astro-x-svelte-static-pages-generator";
const isMerryChristmas = checkDate("25 December 2025");
```
